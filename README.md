# CS50 Scratch 2025 — Complete Solution Set by Baljit Panda

Welcome to this repository, which contains **all of my submitted solutions for Harvard University's CS50 Scratch (CS50S) course for the year 2025**. This collection represents my work as a student of computer science fundamentals using Scratch, as taught by David J. Malan and the CS50 team.

I am publishing these solutions solely for educational and reference purposes. The intent is to provide learners with an example of how one might approach and solve the problem sets within the course. **These files are _not_ meant to be copied, submitted, or otherwise used in violation of CS50’s Academic Honesty policy.**
